# Clark-Wilson model

The Clark-Wilson Model also aims to achieve integrity by using the following concepts:

* Constrained Data Item (CDI): This refers to the data type whose integrity we want to preserve.
* Unconstrained Data Item (UDI): This refers to all data types beyond CDI, such as user and system input.
* Transformation Procedures (TPs): These procedures are programmed operations, such as read and write, and should maintain the integrity of CDIs.
* Integrity Verification Procedures (IVPs): These procedures check and ensure the validity of CDIs.
